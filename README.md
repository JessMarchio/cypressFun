# My Cypress Test Automation Project Guide

Welcome to my Cypress Test Automation Project! This guide will help you get started with setting up and running tests using this repository.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run tests locally:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Node.js (v14 or higher) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cypress-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cypress-project
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

You have two options for running tests:

1. **Run tests headlessly**: Execute Cypress tests in headless mode (without UI):

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Open Cypress Test Runner**: Open Cypress Test Runner to execute tests interactively:

   ```bash
   npm run open
   ```

### Writing Tests

You can write your Cypress tests in the `cypress/integration` directory. Each JavaScript file in this directory represents a test suite. The tests in this project interact with the [demoqa.com](https://demoqa.com/) website.

Refer to the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html) for more information on writing tests.

## Additional Features

### Fixtures

The `fixtures` directory contains static data files that you might use in your tests, such as JSON files, CSVs, or text files.

### Plugins

The `plugins` directory can be used to extend Cypress's functionality. You can add plugins for tasks like instrumenting code, integrating with third-party tools, or modifying Cypress behavior.

### Support

The `support` directory contains reusable code and custom commands that can be used across your tests. It's a good place to put common utilities, custom commands, or configurations that you want to use globally in your tests.
